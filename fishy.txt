In the deeps of the sea
In the deep water blue
lived a fish who could wish
And each wish would come true.

Oh the fun he would have
Oh the things he woul do
Just wishing away
In the deep water blue.

He wished for a castle
He wished for a car
He wished for a horse
And a Spanish Guitar.

He wanted to fly
And to his delight
Went once round the world
In exactly one night.
